Udacity - FEND Nanodegree Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1

Overview
This is my Project for Udacity front end web developer nanodegree.

In this project I convertedt the provided site to use responsive design. Implemented accessibility features using ARIA in HTML sites.Added ServiceWorker Script to cache requests so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline.

What do I do from here??
1)Download zip
2)In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this.
3)In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
4)With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000.
